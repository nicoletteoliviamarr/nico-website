            For my research topic, I wanted to delve in to the sensitive topic
            of abuse towards nurses. As a future nurse with an RN as my mom, I
            understand that nurse abuse is an issue that is not discussed
            enough. At some point in time, this issue has become a normal,
            anticipated part of being a nurse as most nurses can expect to be
            abused by their patients (and even other coworkers). Below, I
            included some interesting articles/studies about nurse abuse. These
            sources stood out to me the most and contain many details about why
            it happens, who it most likely will affect, and the negative
            consequences of experiencing nurse abuse.
